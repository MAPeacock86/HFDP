These are my notes and a dotNet work-through of the book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/) by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson.

## Design Principles 
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. 
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance

## Captains Log
2021-01-10: Finished Chapter 1 and finished the initial setup for chapter 2! 

2020-11-26: Been a few weeks, had finals to take! Tonight I wrote part of the write-up for the Strategy Pattern. Excited to move towards wrapping that up soon. 

2020-11-06: I will now embark on my 1,001st attempt at coding my way through Head First Design Patterns and 
creating a repository of patterns and examples. Dear world, wish me luck! 

2020-11-07: Completed almost all the strategy pattern example. Need to finish out a second step and then work on how 
I want to write this up!
